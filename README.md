Personal Website Build Project

This Repository houses all the source code used to create the website [KevinDarty.com](http://www.KevinDarty.com)

[KevinDarty.com](http://www.KevinDarty.com) is hosted on github.io so the idea is that the output "dist" compiled version of the web application is what gets published to github.io.

As with the original purpose of the KevinDarty.com website, this project is an exercise in working with modern web application development tools such as:

* Yeoman
* Bower
* Node.js
* Gulp
* Saas

And of course whatever other frameworks and technologies I add into the mix :-)
